/**
 * Wrapper around ReplSetTest for testing rollback behavior. It allows the caller to easily
 * transition between stages of a rollback without having to configure the replset explicitly.
 *
 * This library exposes the following 3 sequential stages of rollback:
 * 1. RollbackTest starts in kSteadyStateOps: the replica set is in steady state replication.
 *        Operations applied will be replicated.
 * 2. kRollbackOps: operations applied during this phase will not be replicated and eventually be
 *        rolled back.
 * 3. kSyncSourceOps: operations applied during this stage will not be replicated initially,
 *        causing the data-bearing nodes to diverge. The data will be replicated after other
 *        nodes are rolled back.
 * 4. kSteadyStateOps: (back to stage 1) with the option of waiting for the rollback to finish.
 *
 * Please refer to the various `transition*` functions for more information on the behavior
 * of each stage.
