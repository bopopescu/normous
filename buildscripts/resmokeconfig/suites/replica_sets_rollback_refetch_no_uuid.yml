# This test suite exists to provide basic coverage of the 'rollbackViaRefetchNoUUID' rollback
# method. This rollback method will be removed in 3.8, so this test suite can also be removed in
# 3.8.

  # The tests listed below are rollback "machinery" tests, that should not depend on the specific
  # types of operations being rolled back. Therefore, they should be able to run on both the
  # 'rollbackViaRefetch' algorithm and the 'rollbackViaRefetchNoUUID' algorithm.
